    <Text>SOLANUM: This place is our school. It teaches us about the universe, stars, singularities, gravity, and everything related to it. It wasn't so unstable before, and I'm not sure, but I remember the blackhole being smaller.</Text>

    <Text>SOLANUM: As a student, it was easy for me to imagine the universe collapsing because I never imagined it could happen in my lifetime...</Text>

    <Text>SOLANUM: These buildings are not stable, so I took this gravity crystal just in case. This is the second one by the way. The first one freaked out somehow and inverted gravity, so I had to break it.</Text>

    <Text>SOLANUM: I'm not sure if this happened because of me or because of the black hole effect, but I cannot be 100% certain this one will be stable either.</Text>
